# username_checker
This Username Validation Program checks if a userâ€™s input meets three rules: it must be under 12 characters, contain no digits, and have no spaces. If the username passes all criteria, it confirms successful registration; otherwise, it provides specific error messages. This ensures usernames are short, clean, and consistent.
